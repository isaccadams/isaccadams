# 👋 Hi, I'm Isacc

I'm a student at **Santa Fe College**, born on **March 7, 2007**, and originally from **Miami Beach, Florida, USA** 🇺🇸.  
I’m someone who’s always been curious—especially about how systems work behind the scenes. That curiosity has led me to explore computing, science, cybersecurity, and a wide range of hands-on projects that I use to learn and grow.

## 💡 About Me

From building simple tools to digging into complex system behavior, I love working on tech projects that challenge me to think deeper. I created this GitHub to share what I’m working on, track my learning, and connect with others who enjoy exploring the boundaries of computing.

## 🔬 Interests

I’m passionate about:
- **Computer Engineering** – understanding how hardware and software interact
- **Systems Programming** – especially in `C++`, `Rust`, and `Bash`
- **Cybersecurity** – with a strong focus on ethical hacking, secure systems, and responsible learning
- **Malware Analysis (for Educational Purposes)** – I enjoy studying how malware works to better understand vulnerabilities, defense mechanisms, and how systems behave under stress
- **Science** – I love scientific thinking, logic, and discovery in and out of computing

I believe that learning how things break (and why) is just as important as learning how to build them. It helps me approach programming and security with a deeper understanding and more responsibility.

## 🧰 Languages & Tools I Work With

| Language | Why I Like It |
|----------|----------------|
| `C++`    | Powerful, low-level, and great for systems programming |
| `Java`   | Structured and widely used in academic environments |
| `Python` | Great for automation, scripting, and learning new concepts fast |
| `Bash`   | Ideal for scripting and system-level operations |
| `Rust`   | A modern favorite for safe and efficient systems code |

Other tools & tech I use:
- `Linux`, `WSL`, and `MinGW`
- `Git`, `Vim`, `GCC`, `Clang`
- `Wireshark`, `Ghidra`, and other analysis tools
- `Docker`, `SSH`, and VPS tools for experiments

## 🎮 Gaming & Downtime

Outside of coding and studying, I’m a gamer at heart.  
Some of my favorite games include:
- 🎯 **CS:GO** – love the strategy and precision
- ⚔️ **Call of Duty** – for its fast-paced and immersive action
- 🧠 Puzzle/logic-based games – I enjoy games that challenge the mind
- 🌍 Open-world exploration and modding communities

Gaming is more than fun for me—it’s a great way to explore how game engines work, how networks communicate in real time, and even how cheats or exploits reveal flaws in systems (which also ties into my interest in security).

## 🌱 What I'm Working On

- 🔧 Writing and optimizing C++ and Rust CLI tools  
- 🔍 Studying how malware and trojans operate (ethically and safely, for research)  
- ⚙️ Learning more about NAT traversal and secure server/client architecture  
- 🧠 Building scripting habits and automating my workflow with `Bash` and `Python`  
- 📖 Exploring operating systems and systems-level architecture

## 📌 Life Update

Right now, things are going well. I’m staying focused on learning, making progress in my studies, and continuing to follow my curiosity wherever it takes me. I don’t rush—I take time to understand things deeply and enjoy the process.

I believe in:
- Learning by doing
- Staying kind and calm, no matter how complex the challenge
- Being curious and responsible in everything I explore
- Following God, The creator of the universe.
